# SMS-spam-detection-project

Summary of Understanding the Dataset:-

Data Type: Collection of SMS/text messages.

Labels:

Spam → Unwanted texts (ads, frauds, promotions, phishing).

Ham → Normal texts (personal, transactional, informative).


Features Commonly Observed:

Message length (spam tends to be longer).

Presence of special characters, numbers, URLs, or keywords (e.g., “win”, “free”, “offer”).

Frequency of certain words.


Imbalance Issue: Usually, ham messages are much higher in number compared to spam, so class imbalance is common.


Recommendation for End User :>

1.Always keep the spam filter enabled so that suspicious SMS messages are automatically moved to the spam folder.

2.Review your spam folder occasionally to ensure no important message has been wrongly classified.

3.Do not click on links or share personal details (like OTPs, bank account numbers, or passwords) from SMS messages flagged as spam.

4.If a spam message is missed by the system, mark it as spam manually to help improve the model’s accuracy.

5.Regularly update the application/model to stay protected against new types of spam and fraud attempts.
